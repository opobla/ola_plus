Welcome to API OLA+'s documentation!
================================
This is doc for the OLA+ Restfull API.

The core of the API is the management of two entities: Higher Education Institutions (HEI), Learning Opportunities
Specification (LOS), and the relationship between them.

This API was built with the idea of serving form filling for web pages, therefore there are services very specific to
this end.
